The Model
================

Set up
----------

- There are two regions. Both have their own constant amount of low skilled - immobile - labor force. The low-skilled labor produces agricultural goods
- There are high skill labors, namely entrepreneurs that produce industrial goods, which have the ability to move between regions. The entrepreneurs will move to the region which gives them the higher utility (consumption + production)


Agglomeration
--------

- What leads to agglomeration or dispersion is the difference of the utility of the entrepreneurs of staying in the region (V) or moving the second one (V*). This difference is defined as:
$V-V*=\alpha/(1-\alpha)\cdot ln\{[\lambda\phi+(1-\lambda)]/[\lambda+(1-\lambda)]\}$
$+\alpha(1-\phi)/\sigma\cdot\{[\rho+\lambda]/[\lambda+(1-\lambda)\phi]$
$-[\rho*+(1-\lambda)]/[\lambda\phi+(1-\lambda)]\}$
- In equilibrium this $V-V*=0$
- The difinition of the parameters and the values chosen for the analysis are presented below


----------

|Parameter|Value|Description|
|---------|-----|-----------|
|$\alpha$ |0.3 | Preference for manufactured goods|
|$\sigma$|6|Substitution coefficient|
|$\phi$|0.19|Freeness of Trade|
|$\rho$|1|Ratio of L / total number of entrepreneurs|
|$\rho*$|1|Ratio of L / total number of entrepreneurs|
|$\tau$|1.4|Transportation Cost (multiplier)


Shock analysis
=================

Changes in transportation cost
--------------
- How a change in the transportation cost affects the equilibriums?
- We analyzed the effects of and increase and a decrease of $\tau$
- The graph below present $V-V*$ curves for the baseline case, increase and decrease in $\tau$

----------------

Increase in trasnportation cost
----------

- With a increase of transportation costs the freeness of trade decreases and we get only one stable equilibrium, when $V-V*=0$
- Because is harder to trade between regions, they will be more segregated and disperse

Decrease in trasnportation cost
---------

- With a decrease of transportation costs the freeness of trade increases and only one equilibrium is possible.
- Because is easier to trade between regions, they will be more agglomerated.
- However, this is not a stable equilibrium, as $V-V*$ is an increasing funtion of $\lambda$
- Therefore, all entrepreneurs will concentrate in the other region.


What are the effects on immobile labor Real Wage?
------------

- Nominal wages are parameters in the model defined as 'w'
- To analyse the effects on real wages we just need to understand how these shocks affect price indexes

-----------------

- $p^{home}=\sigma/(1-\sigma)\cdot cw$
- $p^{export}=\sigma/(1-\sigma)\cdot cw\tau$
- 'c'is the parameter that represents costs of production
- When transportation costs increases the number of high skilled labor increases at home and decreases at abroad
- The effective number of firms at home will increases and the effective number of firms abroad will decreases
- Therefore, the Price Index at home decreases and Price Index abroad increases
- Following this, the real wage of immobile sector in home country increases and the real wage of immobile sector abroad decreases
